# Getting started with React

This project was bootstraped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)  
The demo project is an expense tracker built in react that encapsulates the basic concepts:

- components & JSX
- props
- state (useState hook) & events
- lists & conditional output

The project is a guided one, I do not own it, I used it for learning purposes.
